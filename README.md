Quartet RNA reference materials improve the quality of transcriptomic data through ratio-based profiling

As an indispensable tool for transcriptome-wide analysis of differential gene expression, RNA sequencing (RNAseq) has demonstrated great potential in clinical applications such as companion diagnostics and prognostics. However, there is a lack of certified RNA reference materials and the corresponding reference datasets of differential expression for assessing the reliability of RNAseq for its intended use in detecting intrinsically small biological differences in clinical settings such as molecular subtyping of diseases. As part of the Quartet Project for quality control and data integration of multiomics profiling, we established four RNA reference materials derived from immortalized B-lymphoblastoid cell lines from four members of a monozygotic twin family. Additionally, we constructed ratio-based transcriptome-wide reference datasets between two reference samples, providing "ground truth" for cross-platform and cross-lab proficiency test. Moreover, Quartet-sample-based quality metrics were developed for assessing the reliability of RNAseq technology in terms of intra-batch measurement and cross-batch data integration. The small intrinsic biological differences among the Quartet samples enabled sensitive assessment of performance of transcriptomic measurements and their cross-batch integration at the ratio level. The Quartet RNA reference materials combined with the ratio-based reference datasets can serve as unique resources for assessing and improving the quality of transcriptomic data.
